# gotask [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jingweno/gotask.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jingweno/gotask) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jingweno/gotask/tasking?status.png)](http://godoc.org/github.com/jingweno/gotask/tasking)

An idiomatic build tool in Go.

## Motivation

To write build tasks on a Go project in Go instead of Make, Rake or insert your build tool here.
I've written a longer [preach](http://owenou.com/2013/11/27/writing-build-tasks-in-go-with-gotask.html) on the motivation.

## Overview

`gotask` is a simple build tool designed for Go.
It provides a convention-over-configuration way of writing build tasks in Go.
`gotask` is heavily inspired by [`go test`](http://golang.org/pkg/testing).

## Installation

```plain
$ go get -u github.com/jingweno/gotask
```

## Defining a Task

Similar to defining a Go test, create a file called `TASK_NAME_task.go` and name the task function in the
format of

```go
// +build gotask

package main

import "github.com/jingweno/gotask/tasking"

// NAME
//    The name of the task - a one-line description of what it does
//
// DESCRIPTION
//    A textual description of the task function
//
// OPTIONS
//    Definition of what command line options it takes
func TaskXxx(t *tasking.T) {
  ...
}
```

where `Xxx` can be any alphanumeric string (but the first letter must not be in [a-z]) and serves to identify the task name.
The task must be defined inside a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) so that `gotask` can find and compile it.

### Task Name

By default, `gotask` will dasherize the `Xxx` part of the task function name and use it as the task name,
without you further declaring it [in the comments](https://github.com/jingweno/gotask#comments-as-man-page).

### Comments as Man Pageâ„¢

It's a good practice to document tasks in a sensible way.
In `gotask`, the comments for the task function are parsed as the task's man page by following the [man page layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Layout):
Section NAME contains the name of the task and a one-line description of what it does, separated by a "-";
Section DESCRIPTION contains the textual description of the task function;
Section OPTIONS contains the definition of the command line flags it takes.

### Build Tags

The `// +build gotask` [build tag](http://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#Context) constraints task functions to `gotask` build only.
Without the build tag, task functions will be available to application build which may not be desired.

## Compiling Tasks

`gotask` is able to compile defined tasks into an executable using `go build`.
This is useful when you need to distribute your build executables.
See `gotask -c` for details.

## Task Scaffolding

`gotask` is able to generate a task scaffolding to quickly get you started for writing build tasks with the `--generate` or `-g` flag.
The generated task is named as `pkg_task.go` where `pkg` is the name of the package that `gotask` is run:

```plain
// in a folder where package example is defined
$ gotask -g
create example_task.go
```

## Multiple Tasks

You can define multiple task functions by following the `TaskXxx` convention in a task file.
You can also create multiple task files by following the `xxx_task.go` convention.
`gotask` is able to find all tasks in the same directory where it's run.

## Examples

On a [Go project](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization), create a file called `sayhello_task.go` with the following content:

```go
// +build gotask

package main

import (
	"github.com/jingweno/gotask/tasking"
	"os/user"
	"time"
)

// NAME
//    say-hello - Say hello to current user
//
// DESCRIPTION
//    Print out hello to current user
//
// OPTIONS
//    --verbose, -v
//        run in verbose mode
func TaskSayHello(t *tasking.T) {
	user, _ := user.Current()
	if t.Flags.Bool("v") || t.Flags.Bool("verbose") {
		t.Logf("Hello %s, the time now is %s\n", user.Name, time.Now())
	} else {
		t.Logf("Hello %s\n", user.Name)
	}
}
```

Make sure the build tag `// +build gotask` is the first line of the file and there's an empty line before package definition.
The comments of the task should be in the format of the [man page layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Layout).
Running `gotask -h` will display all the tasks:

```plain
$ gotask -h
NAME:
   gotask - Build tool in Go

USAGE:
   gotask [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.8.0

COMMANDS:
   say-hello    Say hello to current user
   help, h      Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --generate, -g       generate a task scaffold named pkg_task.go
   --compile, -c        compile the task binary to pkg.task but do not run it
   --debug              run in debug mode
   --version            print the version
   --help, -h           show help
```

Running `gotask say-hello -h` will display usage for a task.
Noticing section NAME of the comments appears as the task name and usage for
`say-hello`, section DESCRIPTION becomes the description, section OPTIONS becomes the options:

```plain
$ gotask say-hello -h
NAME:
   say-hello - Say hello to current user

USAGE:
   command say-hello [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   Print out hello to current user

OPTIONS:
   --verbose, -v        run in verbose mode
   --debug              run in debug mode
```

To execute the task, type:

```plain
$ gotask say-hello
Hello Owen Ou
```

To execute the task in verbose mode, type:

```plain
$ gotask say-hello -v
Hello Owen Ou, the time now is 2013-11-20 15:32:00.73771438 -0800 PST
```

To compile the task into an executable named `pkg.task` where pkg is the
last segment of the import path using `go build`, type:

```plain
$ gotask -c
```

Running the compiled tasks yields the same result:

```plain
$ ./examples.task say-hello
Hello Owen Ou
```
